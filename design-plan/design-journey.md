# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Understanding Users (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

They both loves apples and every thing thing apples and that made them show up tat the festival to explore the various varieties of apples available and explore other things as well.


## Festival/Event Website Design Exploration (Milestone 1)

Identify three festival or event websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web. You will be drawing inspiration from these sites for your own site; please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

1. <https://www.coachella.com/>

    ![A narrow screenshot of the Coachella](images/../../images/eg5.png)

    ![A wide screenshot of the Coachella](images/../../images/eg4.png)

2. <https://renfair.com/ny/>

The contrast between the colours of the texts and the background was excuted well, and it makes the text legible despite the different background colors. I also think that the screen in too busy, there is text every where, there is no breathing space for the content on the webpage.


### Festival/Event Website 3 Review (Milestone 1)

2. I want my website to spark the feeling of liveliness and joy in my users, I will use bright colors like orange and yellow to achieve this.
3. I want my website to be less formal and spark liveliness in my users, hence most of the images on the website will have rounded corners and the colour scheme will be a combination of orange and green to effect the feeling.
  Chosen Theme
I will use the 3rd theme because it will be appropriate in meeting the goals of my audience. IThe layoutmakes the website less formal and creates a picture of how welcoming the event will be. The color scheme will also make them feel lively.

I want to make use of the space available on the wide screen, hence the layout of the main content will be side by side

![The narrow layout](images/../../images/l2%20(2).jpg)

To make the content readable on a narrow page, I have decided to stack the content on top of the other in order to make it usable.

> Include both narrow and wide versions of each page.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.

My design appropriate for my users because it addresses their needs and meet their goal. My website provide the relevant information my users will need about the Apple Harvest festival. some of these information inclides the time, date and events for the festival. I have also provided information on transportation, things that will be available to purchase the means of purchasing and also a list of food vendors that will be present at the event. I organized the content on my page based on similarity and those that are mostly sort for together, for instance the available means of transportation for people that do not own a car which is mostly the Tcat buses and the bus schedule. I used the same design pattern througout the styling of my all my webpages to ensure consistency.

## Rationale (Final Submission)

**This rationale should be polished writing:** one you might submit as a report to a client or boss to help explain the project and convince them you did a good job. You'll be surprised how much writing and communicating you need to do about projects and choices on internships and jobs; practice that here.

It should be a comprehensive, complete story of the project. You might find that each section runs about a paragraph. Sketches can often help tell the story of your design.

Your rationale should be a polished version of the earlier explanations.
